# Tile Molester

Tile Molester is a multi-format, user-extensible graphics data editor that lets you create, view and edit graphics in arbitrary binary files, with a particular focus on binaries for game consoles.

It was originally developed SnowBro and later improved by Central MiB and Lab313. Mewster merged those changes and updates into the original source code and added some other improvements as well, which I used as a base to add UI improvements.
